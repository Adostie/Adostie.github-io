<h2> Last Year I was a student at Arcadia University in Philadelphia and I was a history/ political science major with a concentration in International Peace and Conflict Resolution! In the IPCR Department I was able to go on a field study to the African Nation of Benin and was able to learn about the current state of reparatoins being made towards the families of those who are still feeling the repercussions of the colonial slave trading. </h2>
